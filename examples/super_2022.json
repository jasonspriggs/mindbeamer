It didn't take long for gaming to pull from genre fiction - Dune, Discworld, Shannara and Pern were adapted as games long before they were to screen, and some, like the adaptation of I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, were proof of gaming’s potential.\r\n\r\nNovels from Ender's Game to Snow Crash proved prophetic about the growing impact of gaming. Some of gaming’s biggest franchises, even when not adapting directly, were clearly influenced by it - most famously a riff on Larry Niven's Ringworld by the name of Halo.\r\n \r\nToday, we're seeing a new trend - books heavily influenced by gaming, as well as some of the biggest titles in the world, such as The Witcher and Metro, adapting recent works of the genre. Together, they offer as much as they always have - for game developers, stories to pull from, for writers, new ways to see their work adapted, and for gamers and readers alike, countless new worlds to explore. \r\n\r\nThere will be prize giveaways, so stay sharp, and come ready!",

    "description": "Space-themed video games have enjoyed perennial popularity in the American video game industry. They are present in “big moments” in the history of the medium, from the development and proliferation of SpaceWar! to Atari’s origins with Nolan Bushnell’s Computer Space to the global phenomenon of Taito’s Space Invaders. But what accounts for the space theme’s popularity?\r\nDrawing upon the academic fields of Science and Technology Studies, the History of Computing, and the History of Science Fiction, this presentation offers three reasons why the space theme was so valuable to the nascent American video game industry: (1) it was a vehicle for technical experimentation, (2) it prompted organizational innovation, and (3) it drove the attraction of a base of players for this new medium.\r\nIn covering case studies such as SpaceWar!’s prehistory, game pioneer Danielle Bunten Berry’s mission to build a better multiplayer game with M.U.L.E., and the proposed inclusion in Atari’s 1983 Star Wars arcade cabinet of technology to awaken powers of extrasensory perception in the American public, this presentation will show why space mattered to an industry in its adolescence and why studying its popularity matters to the history of a beloved technology of play: the video game.",

Luckily, there is a science behind it to explain how communication works, and when it doesn’t work, why. \r\nAlmost all communication can be simplified down to a single representative model, and we will see how each element of it can make the difference between an exhilarating victory or a crushing defeat (or missing that side order of fries).

Faces will melt.\r\n\r\nMagnificent Danger:\r\nMagnificent Danger is a collective of mobile brass & percussion dishing out weird and funky mashups of iconic tunes from video games, anime, TV shows, and more. The band's eclectic fusion of New Orleans street band energy, riot jazz, and hip-hop has created a bizarre but danceable party that's appreciated by musicians and nerds alike.\r\n\r\nMaster Sword:\r\nThe Legend of Zelda gets HEAVY with Master Sword - the original power metal band based around Zelda lore and all those famous melodies you love.\r\n\r\nThe Audio Gremlins:\r\nTHE AUDIO GREMLIMS \r\n\r\n‘The Audio Gremlins’ were born in Everett, MA amongst an industrial Hell of breweries and metal fabrication. For this dynamic trio, no genre is off limits. Franky Language and Treeman scratch samples on vinyl, with Flowttiglio producing beats on drum machine creating a live and unique experience.",

Project OML is a grassroots, community-centered, not-for-profit effort to save a select list of influential, popular, or just plain fun Flash games in an interactive time capsule, where they can then be enjoyed indefinitely. We aim to not only save the games, but also locate the authors of the games themselves, and interview them- finding out information otherwise lost to time. Finally, we will create a dedicated museum piece for the Project, and send it somewhere where we can guarantee the public will be able to access it indefinitely- like the University of Michigan's Computer and Video Game Archive, who have already agreed to host the Project.\r\n\r\nThis panel will explore the 20+ year old community formed around Flash games, the evolution of them over time, their impact on pop culture and gaming as a whole, and, finally, how the end of Flash has affected the scene. It will talk about our Project as well as touch on similar projects, such as BlueMaxima's Flashpoint. Finally, and, most importantly, it will educate the public on the importance of culture preservation, so that we don't lose these games to time like we did early films.",

    "description": "Do you smell that funk? Thankfully, you won’t need a gasmask for this event, because we’re about to get down and dirty on the fundamentals of making great grooves!\r\n\r\nWe’ll demonstrate and discuss methods of working alone and together as a band to make everyone’s feet tap and heads bob. We’ll also show you what it means to get in the “pocket,” help you develop your sense of time across multiple styles of music, refine instrumentation roles for comping and soloing, and in the spirit of the MAGFest Jam Clinic, have fun jamming together!\r\n\r\nIf you want to get down like James Brown and Jamiroquai met ToeJam & Earl on a Sonic the Hedgehog act, come on in! This workshop is for all skill levels and instruments, and we hope it will help you elevate your musicianship skills in both traditional and video game music contexts.",

    "description": "Negativland + SUE-C\r\n\"We Can Really Feel Like We’re Here\"\r\nA live cinema + music + sound collage performance piece for MAGFest\r\n \r\n Does technology help connect people?  Or does it replace them?  As the tools of one age become the masters of the next, it’s precisely the gaming community that knows the Metaverse existed long before its recent corporate rebranding.  In \"We Can Really Feel Like We’re Here,\" live cinema artist SUE-C and metamedia group Negativland collage the last century’s worth of technology — the one now being resold back to us as our future.  But from Sensorama to Oculus, from Second Life to PlayStation Home, from I Love Bees to Twitter — there’s only so much gamification that the real world is ever going to allow.\r\n\r\nNEGATIVLAND\r\nSince 1980, the multimedia collective known as Negativland have been creating records, CDs, video, fine art, books, radio and live performance using appropriated sounds, images, objects, and text. Mixing original materials and original music with things taken from corporately owned mass culture and the world around them, Negativland re-arrange these found bits and pieces to make them say and suggest things that they never intended to. In doing this kind of cultural archaeology and \"culture jamming\" (a term they coined way back in 1984), Negativland have been sued twice for copyright infringement. Their art and media interventions pose both serious and silly questions about the nature of sound, media, technology, control, ownership, propaganda, power, and perception in the United States of America. Their work is now referenced and taught in many college courses in the US, has been written about and cited in over 150 books and legal journals, and their favorite video game is Katamari Damacy.\r\n\r\nSUE-C\r\nSUE-C is a projectionist, engineer and educator working at the intersection of creative coding and live performance. She has created handmade videos and live media performances, taught college level courses and workshops, and traveled extensively in the USA and internationally since 1999. Her work blends technology, photography, video and everyday objects into an improvisational animation “instrument” using her own custom software and live cameras. Working in tandem with musicians, “her camera is equipped like a microscope, turning the scrap store objects into a visual equivalent of ASMR.” (From The Wire, November 2021). When not performing, teaching, parenting or making NFTs she is usually trying to finish a stack of books while petting one of five cats.",

I explored how a trans musician might develop an identity that aligned with the gender they wanted to present, construct a digital self that affirms their gender identity, and interacted parasocially—mediated exchanges that are at least as meaningful as offline relationships—with other YouTube users and VGM musicians on the platform. This case study (modeled from Stake, 1995) explored how a well-established YouTube Video Game Music musician, Amie Waters, used social media platforms and her music to express herself as she came out as trans to her audiences online. Amie’s experiences and practices can inform how we in music education might encourage trans students to pursue music—both online and offline—that expresses their gender and other aspects of their identities in positive and meaningful ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmie found trans resources and role models on online platforms, which helped her develop her identity as a non-binary person. She used Twitter, her personal blog, and YouTube to present her self-image while interacting parasocially with others who provided her emotional, creative, and financial support. Amie’s YouTube channel included coming out in which she explained who she was, her gender, and how her music helped her understand herself and process emotions. Furthermore, she released two albums of electronic music one inspired by her sexuality and the other by her gender. Her musical releases on YouTube helped Amie construct, perform, and express her identity. Amie’s DIY music and recording processes bore a video archive of comings out that show how music can be used understand gender, trans identity, and sexuality, as well as how music empowered Amie through composition and the creation of recordings. Amie's original music and video game music covers helped her work through emotions and provide acceptance and understanding of her own life.",

(Looking for a virtual recreation of the concert hall to relive a past year's concert? We gotchu.) Best of all, the MAGLord is free to all, either on VR or desktop (PC), on the free VRChat platform.\r\n\r\nOur panel of project developers will talk about the goals, themes, and features of these virtual spaces; the tools and technologies that power them; the community and events these spaces have served over the pandemic year; and the development efforts of the group of MAG staff and fans that have put it all together. We'll also showcase some of the best that VRChat has to offer, with a showcase of our favorite partner projects and VR worlds! \r\n\r\nQ&A to follow, and catch us after to talk more about the ongoing project!",

AI research has contributed a lot to video games, but now the tables have turned and researchers are using video games not as an application for AI, but as a research tool.  This panel will talk about the surpising and unexpected changes to the relationship between video games and artificial intelligence with a focus on the last five years of explosive research progress.  AI has changed from hand-coded programs that follow human-designed tactics to machine-learned models that learn their own tactics and video games are providing the means for researchers to develop math and tools that outperform most AIs ever created and sometimes even the very best humans.  We'll discuss research challenges, research milestones, significant breakthrough applications, and some advice and resources for anyone who wants to get into AI as a researcher, game developer, engineer, or even just hobbyist, at each step using the relationship between games and AI as context.",

Heroism, as a concept, is rooted in community service and individual sacrifice, which has become an anathema in today’s “you do you” cultural ethic. How has that relativistic self-oriented ethos transformed our notions of heroes in both video games and tabletop gaming? Join us as we explore the ethics of game characters and the trends of heroism in recent game worlds.",

After years of highs and lows, more than 30 years later, Fire Emblem has finally come into its own as one of Nintendo’s top-tier franchises.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we celebrate and discuss the rise, fall and return of Fire Emblem, from the early Japan-only SNES titles Americans are only now discovering, how a pair of Smash Bros fighters finally saw the US exposed to the series. We'll talk about the near death of the franchise before Fire Emblem: Awakening saved (or ruined?) the series, to the release of Fire Emblem: Three Houses as one of the Switch’s killer apps. And where does the franchise go from here?\r\n\r\nWe’ll dig into just what makes the franchise special, such as mechanics like permadeath, how it works as a work of high fantasy, how big a role “shipping” has played in the series’ success (and why that’s realistic for a military game), and how a cult series grew to become beloved by fans, gamers and cosplayers the world over. \r\n\r\nThere will be prize giveaways, so grab your sword and brush up your support levels, as we celebrate three decades of Fire Emblem!",
